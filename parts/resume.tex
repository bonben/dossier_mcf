\section{Research}
\label{subsec:rech}
These works have all been realized during my 3-years thesis.

\subsubsection{Polar Codes}

The main theme of my thesis was the decoding of polar codes. Polar codes are a recently invented class of error-correcting codes that are of interest to researchers and industry, as evidenced by their selection for the coding of control channels in the next generation of mobile telephony (5G). One of the challenges of future mobile networks is the virtualization of digital signal processing, and in particular channel encoding and decoding algorithms. In order to improve network flexibility, these algorithms must be described in software and deployed on programmable architectures. Such a network infrastructure makes it possible to better distribute the computational effort over all nodes and to improve cooperation between cells. These techniques are designed to reduce energy consumption, increase throughput and reduce communication latency. The work presented in the thesis manuscript focused on the software implementation of polar code decoding algorithms and the design of specialized programmable architectures for their execution.


\subsubsection{Software implementation of decoding algorithms for polar codes on general purpose processors}

One of the main characteristics of a mobile communication chain is the instability of the communication channel. In order to address this instability, adaptive modulation and coding techniques are used in communication standards. These techniques require that decoders support a wide range of codes: they must be generic. The first contribution of this work is the software implementation of generic decoders of "Successive Cancellation List" (SCL) decoding algorithms on general purpose processors \cite{leonardon_2019}. The SIMD units present on modern processors make it possible to exploit the parallelism available in polar code decoding algorithms.

This first contribution involved the definition of two distinct concepts: the genericity and flexibility of a polar code decoder. Flexibility, on the one hand, is the ability of a decoder to adapt to a communications standard. Indeed, the parameters such as the size of a frame, the number of bits of information, the concatenation of a CRC code, the ability to manage punching patterns, are elements defined by the standard. A generic decoder must be able to support this genericity with respect to the encoding scheme. On the other hand, the flexibility of a polar code decoder corresponds to the possibility of adjusting the algorithm and implementation of the decoder in order to propose compromises between data rate and latency, for the same encoding scheme. Parameters that concern flexibility are for example the depth of the list for SCL algorithms, the representation format of integers (quantification) or the management of adaptive algorithmic variants of the SCL algorithm.
The proposed decoder aims to be as generic and flexible as possible. The genericity and flexibility of the proposed decoder are superior to all state of the art implementations of list decoding algorithms, which are the algorithms with the best decoding performance.

In addition, algorithmic and implementation improvements are proposed, allowing to increase the performance of bit rates and decoding latency. Despite increased genericity and flexibility, the decoding rates achieved are higher (up to a factor of 5) than those in the literature. A version of the decoders proposed was also ported to ARM. It uses the SIMD NEON instruction set. While lower throughput are achieved, it is shown that power consumption on ARM is reduced compared to implementations on x86 architecture processors.
The decoders are all integrated into the AFF3CT software suite (\url{aff3ct.github.io}). The source code is therefore made available to the scientific community and the results are easily reproducible.

\subsubsection{ASIP decoder of polar codes: Customization of a processor}


The second contribution of my thesis work is the proposal of a new high-performance programmable architecture specialized in the decoding of polar codes \cite{Leonardon2018a}. 
It results from the following observation: if the data rates achieved by software decoders are high, especially when considering multi-core architectures, their weak point is their energy consumption. Therefore, the challenge is to identify architectures that can maintain high flexibility while being more energy efficient. The ASIP (Application Specific Instruction set Processor) family of processors is an efficient and elegant solution.

The approach we first chose is the one proposed by the Cadence / Tensilica tools. A simple RISC processor is the basis of XTensa processors. This base can be configured. We have therefore eliminated the superfluous (floating point computing units, hardware accelerators for multiplication) and added parallel instructions (VLIW: Very Large Instruction Word). The instruction set of XTensa processors can also be extended, in conjunction with the definition of hardware units specialized in the application of interest to us, i. e. the decoding of polar codes.
One of the advantages of this solution is that the algorithm is defined in software form, allowing for rapid development.

The consumption and occupied area metrics are then generated by the tool. A simulator is used to execute the algorithm and thus measure the number of cycles required to decode the frames. The results obtained show that this architecture achieves speeds and latencies close to state-of-the-art software implementations on general purpose processors. Energy consumption is reduced by an order of magnitude. Indeed, when considering decoding by successive cancellation of a polar code (1024,512), the energy required per decoded bit is about 10 nJ on general purpose processors versus 1 nJ on the proposed processor.

\subsubsection{ASIP decoder of polar codes: Full design of a processor}

The third contribution of my thesis work is also a processor architecture with instruction set dedicated to the application. It addresses the same issue: to offer a flexible implementation by increasing throughput, latency and energy consumption performance. It differs from the previous one in that it uses an alternative design methodology. Instead of being based on a RISC architecture, the proposed processor architecture is part of the Transport Triggered Architectures (TTA) class. These architectures are made up of functional units that perform data operations (loading, saving, calculating) and transport buses that connect them. In a traditional processor architecture, the content of the instruction is the operation to be performed with the addresses of the input and output data. In TTA architectures, each bus is assigned an instruction during each cycle. Each instruction contains a source port and a destination port. This is called an exposed data path: the programmer (or compiler) can specify the data path for each instruction. This property allows fine optimizations of the implementation of an algorithm.

A suite of free development tools is available from Tampere University (\url{http://openasip.org/}). The latter allows to automate a large part of the design of such a processor and also offers a compiler that adapts to the specialized architecture. Thus, just like the previous ASIP, the decoding algorithm is described using a high-level language. The polar code decoder of TTA architecture realized was prototyped on FPGA and its synthesis was realized for an ASIC target in ST FD-SOI technology 28 nm \cite{Leonardon2018b}. The measured throughput are then higher than those obtained on general purpose processors. The energy consumption is reduced to about 0.1 nJ per decoded bit for a polar code (1024,512) with the successive cancellation decoding algorithm. This corresponds to a reduction of two orders of magnitude compared to the consumption measured on general purpose processors, and a reduction of one order of magnitude compared to ASIP using the Cadence / Tensilica tools.

\subsubsection{Studies on Sparse Code Multiple Access decoder}

During my stay at Polytechnique Montréal, as part of my thesis work, I became interested in the implementation of a SCMA (Sparse Code Multiple Access) decoder. SCMA is a promising non-orthogonal multiple access technique for future communication standards. Alirezah Ghaffari proposed computational simplifications of the algorithm to accelerate decoding processing. In order to ensure the real performance of this simplification, we have integrated this SCMA decoder into a complete communication chain. It is also integrated into AFF3CT to make the source code available to the community and also to allow the results to be reproduced. This work is described in \cite{Ghaffari2017}. In a second step, we focused on accelerating the software implementation of these algorithms on general purpose processors, by using SIMD instruction sets \cite{ghaffari_2019}. The use of SIMD units in conjunction with the proposed simplifications allows significant gains in throughput and energy consumption, up to an order of magnitude.

\subsubsection{Contribution to the AFF3CT project}
Since 2015, I have been contributing to the development of the AFF3CT project (\url{aff3ct.github.io}). This is a project that offers many software tools related to digital communications. Particular attention is paid to the throughput and latency performance of error-correcting code decoders. 

Used as a simulator, it allows Monte Carlo simulations of the entire communication chain. The data are randomly generated, encoded, modulated, noisy, decoded, and the performance is estimated by measuring the Bit Error Rate (BER) and the Frame Error Rate (FER). The simulator's ambition is threefold: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Reproducibility}: it is often difficult to reproduce the results of the literature. Many parameters can be omitted, which prevent a faithful reproduction of the proposed algorithms. This is why a large database of pre-simulated curves with all the necessary parameters is available. As a result, many research projects use AFF3CT as a reference. Being open-source, software descriptions are accessible to everyone.
    \item \textbf{High-speed simulations}: in order to correctly estimate BER / FER, it is necessary to simulate a hundred erroneous frames for a signal-to-noise ratio value. When the FER to be simulated is low, for example $10^{-7}$, about 1 billion frames must be simulated. When the frames are large, simulation times can be extremely long. It is therefore very useful to have high throughput simulations. This is why we use all the available parallelism: data parallelism, by using SIMD instructions, instruction parallelism, with the use of superscalar and multicore architectures, and finally the use of multiple nodes is ensured through the \texttt{openmpi} library. This allows very high throughput to be achieved. For example, 63 Gbps are reached for the FA-SCL decoder presented in \cite{leonardon_2019} on the miriel node of the PLAFRIM platform (\url{https://www.plafrim.fr/en/the-platform/hardware-documentation/}).
    \item \textbf{Heterogeneity of algorithms}: in the field of error-correcting code decoders, there are very many decoding algorithms. It is therefore often very difficult to make an exhaustive comparison with the existing system. The ambition of AFF3CT is to cover as many algorithmic variants of the literature as possible to facilitate the work of researchers.
\end{enumerate}

AFF3CT can also be used as a library. Thus, any developer can use the elementary bricks available. This possibility is widely used by our industrial partners (Airbus, Thales,...) to integrate AFF3CT blocks into their communication chains, whether for simulation or for real communicating systems (software radio).
