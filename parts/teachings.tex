\subsubsection{Electronics Design Project}
\label{subsubsec:loto}
\begin{description}\parskip 0pt
\item[Person in charge:] Mathieu Léonardon
\item[Level :] First year ENSEIRB - equivalent L3
\item[Volume :] 2 x 25 Hours
\item[Content :]  
The first part of this module is a course on FPGA design flow.
The state machines are also presented and some exercises are proposed.
This is followed by a project to design a digital architecture. The objectives are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item design a hardware architecture,
        \item acquire VHDL skills,
        \item develop a synthetic mind for the writing of the report,
        \item acquire skills in project presentation with a defense.
    \end{itemize}
    
The project is the realization of a Lotto on a Nexys 4 card. The end user must be able to draw 6 numbers at random, without removing them. These numbers are displayed on 7-segment displays.

\subsubsection{Combinatory logic and sequential logic}
\label{subsubsec:en1}
\begin{description}\parskip 0pt
\item[Person in charge:] Christophe Jégo
\item[Level :] First year ENSEIRB-MATMECA - equivalent L3
\item[Volume :] 1 x 32 Hours
\item[Content :] ~

\begin{itemize}
\item The elementary combinatorial and sequential functions used in digital circuits,
\item the modeling of numerical functions using the VHDL language.
\end{itemize}
At the end of the course, the student must be able to:
\begin{itemize} 
\item to describe a combinatorial function and represent it with a digital circuit,
\item to describe and synthesize a counter, a state machine,
\item to identify the critical path of a complex logical function and calculate its maximum operating frequency.
\end{itemize}
Six four-hour tutorial sessions of four full hours each. Each session is divided into two parts. 
Themes are dealt with in the first part. 
In a second part, the defined digital systems are described in the hardware description language VHDL. 
This approach gradually introduces students to this language.

\noindent \subsubsection{Microprocessor project}
\begin{description}\parskip 0pt
\item[Person in charge:] Valéry Lebret
\item[Level :] First year ENSEIRB-MATMECA - equivalent L3
\item[Volume :] 1 x 36 Hours
\item[Content:] This course aims to program MICROCHIP PIC microcontrollers, chosen for their ease of implementation due to their low complexity. 
After a presentation of this family of microcontrollers and their specificities, the activity begins by writing simple programs in assembler language to illustrate the operation of the microcontroller (coding and execution of instructions, access to registers, management of internal resources and inputs/outputs, etc.). 
An application card integrating a PIC16F84 serves as a support, with software development being carried out using the MPLABX integrated tool chain, which includes a simulator. 
Programming is then carried out in C language with the purpose of implementing a project (e. g. a quartz clock on an LCD display) using the PICDEM2 development board with a PIC16F877 target (more internal resources, possibility of debugging). The focus is on the limitations encountered on embedded systems when programming in C language (reduced memory space, limited computing power, etc.) as well as on interrupt management.

\begin{description}\parskip 0pt
\item[Person in charge:] Jérémie Crenne
\item[Level :] Second year ENSEIRB-MATMECA - equivalent M1
\item[Volume :] 1 x 16 Hours
\item[Content:] This course aims to strengthen knowledge by addressing more advanced techniques related to processors and memories. This course is based on the book by J.L. Hennessy and A. Patterson "Computer Architecture, a quantitative approach". RISC and CISC architectures, pipeline architectures, data and control hazards are discussed. The case of the MIPS processor is studied in detail to give students a concrete example of a processor architecture.
The purpose of this course is to enable students to understand the most sophisticated multi/many-core systems.

\item[Person in charge:] Yannick Bornat
\item[Level :] Second year ENSEIRB-MATMECA - equivalent M1
\item[Volume :] 1 x 42 Hours
\item[Content :] 
All practical works are performed on the AT91SAM7X256 microcontroller. This microcontroller has an ARM7 core, many peripherals and a vectorized and configurable interrupt system.
The objective of the course is to use the different hardware resources to design a minimalist operating system that meets the specific needs of microcontrollers for real-time tasks.
The concepts cover real-time aspects, communication, data integrity.
Students are placed in a situation where their only source of documentation is the manufacturer's technical documents in English.

\item[Content :] 
This course aims to provide students with the basics of object-oriented programming. The general concepts of object-oriented programming are being introduced. The C++ language is used to illustrate the concepts manipulated. All these concepts are used in a project to illustrate in a practical way the interest of this programming approach.
